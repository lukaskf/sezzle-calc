# Sezzle Coding Challenge: Calculator

This is a coding challenge for an application to work at a company Sezzle. The challenge was to build a webapp calculator that displayed the previous ten calculations within a reasonably short period of time. This implementation uses a Flask framework for Python and SQLAlchemy database. 
Enjoy! 

## Getting Started

To run this web application locally, create a clone of this repository on your machine.
To activate the virtual environment enter the following command:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Then to run the application enter the following command:
```
flask run
```
Open your browser and go to 
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### Prerequisites

Everything should be installed within the virtual environment, make sure to activate before trying to run!

### Notes on Deployment

Due to time constraints and other projects/work the database component proved to be an issue with deployment, look in the near future for a url to the site!
